Google demonstrates the most aggressive RnD strategy, averaging 115.89M USD in spending and generating the highest AI revenue at 77.88M USD. Meta follows with 72.42M USD in RnD and 51.91M USD in revenue, but achieves the strongest efficiency with an ROI of 0.67 compared to Google’s 0.63 and OpenAI’s 0.34. OpenAI invests the least (7.25M USD) with revenue of 2.59M USD, yet shows the fastest growth (6.81× from 2015–2024). Correlation analysis confirms a strong link between RnD and revenue (0.94) but almost none with stock impact (~0). OpenAI has the strongest reactions to events (avg impact 2.98%), with major spikes at GPT-4 and GPT-5 releases. Overall, Google scales, Meta optimizes, OpenAI disrupts.
